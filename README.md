# ChattyFwends
 A wholesome ChatRoom concept
 ChattyFwends is a concept of a cozy, fun ChatRoom web application that allows you to create your own account and talk to your friends!

 Things that I'm currently learning/using while trying to develop this application:
 -> FrontEnd development(html, css, javascript)
 -> BackEnd development: Using PHP for the first time to get and store data on a MySQL database
 Also using XAMPP for the first time to deploy a web server, mySQL server and everything i need to test my application

Things i want to accomplish:
 -> Getting the LOGIN page design
 -> Taking the login information (username and password) on an HTML form through a PHP script
 -> Storing the login information in a mySQL database
 -> Designing the chatRoom page 
 -> Generating FwendCodes (my own slang for friend codes)
 -> Storing message information on the database as associations between users
